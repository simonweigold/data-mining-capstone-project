# Introduction and theoretical framework

Predicting the stock market has been of great interest for researchers and business professionals likewise (Mittel & Goel, 2012; Nguyen et al., 2015; Parmar et al., 2018). The opportunities that come with investing in listed companies have created not only fascination for private investors but also professional career paths and whole industries (Amadeo, 2022; Indeed Editorial Team, 2023). The way the stock market works is that companies in certain instances decide to "go public" (Hall, 2021), i.e. the company offers shares for sale to the public, and anyone who would like to participate can buy these shares. With the availability of many shares from a wide range of different companies the stock market developed: a place, where investors buy and sell shares of publicly traded companies (Chen, 2023). The dynamics on the stock market are driven by the fluctuations of prices of stocks which can depend on factors such as companies' performances, industry trends and overall market conditions (Huy et al., 2020).\
Since this dynamic establishes itself from an interchange between humans (executives at public companies, investors, financial advisors, just to name a few), communication can be expected to influence behaviours within this dynamic (Argan et al., 2014; Gardner et al., 2017). Mass communication in particular has a special role to play, as news channels such as newspapers, radio or television report on listed companies and thus create a certain image for the public's perception and opinion-forming (Roberts & Bachen, 1981). News report on companies' financial performances, changes in management, mergers and acquisitions and other relevant information that can affect the prices of stocks. It has been proven that investors form their perception of companies and stocks not only through metrics and balance sheets but also news publications. Ultimately, this influences the purchasing and selling behaviour of investors and therefore affects the stock price (Li et al., 2014; Shah et al., 2018).\
To analyse the correlation between news and stock performance, researchers have often used the tool of sentiment analysis in previous research projects (Mittel & Goel, 2012; Shah et al., 2018, Sousa et al., 2019). Sentiment analysis is a technique which can be used to identify positive, neutral, or negative opinions within a given text (Stine, 2019). Usually, the analysed text comes from news articles, social media posts or customer reviews (Mejova, 2009). To analyse sentiments in the context of stock performance, Twitter data has been studied for instance (Elbagir & Yang, 2019). To understand the effect of more traditional types of mass media, it may also be useful to analyse news articles and/or their headlines. Thus, this research project aims to answer the following research question:\
*To what extent do the stock performance of the company Amazon and the sentiment of news headlines of articles about Amazon from The Guardian correlate?*\
Since previous empirical evidence demonstrates significant relationships between mass media sentiments and stock performance, the following hypothesis is established:\
*There is a correlation between the sentiment of news headlines of articles about Amazon from the Guardian and the stock performance of the company Amazon.*

# Methodology

Before starting with the collection of data, all used packages are loaded now. Note, that to successfully execute the Python code chunk, Python needs to be installed on the used device. Note that if not set up within RStudio yet, the libraries "os", "nltk" and "pandas" likely require installation.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rio)
library(here)
library(lubridate)
library(httr)
library(rstudioapi)
library(guardianapi)
```

```{python}
import os
import nltk
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
import pandas as pd
```

Once all packages have been loaded, the next step is the data collection. This research project analyses the stock data of Amazon and news headlines from The Guardian. First, the stock data is being retrieved.\
For this, the API by Alpha Vantage (2023) is used. After requesting an API key, the stock ticker of the company, which stock data shall be retrieved needs to be added to a predefined query URL.

```{r}
# Claim API key for access to stock data
browseURL("https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key")

# Set API key and request URL
api_key <- rstudioapi::askForPassword()
request_url <- str_c("https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED&symbol=",
                     "AMZN",
                     "&outputsize=full&apikey=",
                     api_key)
```

This query URL can then be used to send a GET request to the API and save the data on the local machine by using the "content" function of the "httr" package.

```{r}
# Request data from API
amzn_get <- httr::GET(request_url)
amzn_content <- httr::content(amzn_get)
```

After receiving a variety of data for the Amazon stock, it is decided to use the closing price, since it is the most commonly used indicator for evaluating a stock's performance. This specific metric is extracted from the content file with the help of a for loop, which iterates through the list element of the exisiting file. In addition, the same procedure is used for the date of each data point. This creates two lists, which are transformed into a data frame, so that both date and closing data coexist in the respective row of the data frame. Finally, the data frame is stored in the working directory, to save the progress of work and use the data in further analysis steps.

```{r}
# Extract data
close_data <- vector(mode = "list", length = length(amzn_content$`Time Series (Daily)`))
date <- vector(mode = "list", length = length(amzn_content$`Time Series (Daily)`))
for (i in 1:length(close_data)) {
  close_data[i] <- amzn_content$`Time Series (Daily)`[[i]]$`4. close`
  date[i] <- names(amzn_content$`Time Series (Daily)`[i])
}

# Convert to data frame
matrix <- matrix(nrow = length(date), ncol = 2, byrow = T)
for (j in 1:length(date)) {
  matrix[j,] <- c(date[[j]],
                  close_data[[j]])
}
amzn <- as.data.frame(matrix)

# Enhance data frame
colnames(amzn) <- c("date", "close_data")
amzn$date <- as.Date(amzn$date)
amzn$close_data <- as.integer(amzn$close_data)

# Save as csv
write.csv(amzn, here::here("amzn.csv"))
```

In order to collect news headlines for the sentiment analysis, data from a news source needs to be collected. The Guardian offers an API which enables developers and researchers to collect articles and respective data from over 2 million pieces of content (The Guardian, 2023). For R users, a package called "guardianapi" has been developed, which offers wrapper functions for easy access to the API by The Guardian. After registering on The Guardian Website for an API key, it can be stored into R and used to gain access to the data. For the request, the query term and time period are specified.

```{r}
# Request API key
browseURL("https://bonobo.capi.gutools.co.uk/register/developer")

# Load API key
gu_api_key()

# GET request
api_request <- gu_content(query = "amazon",
                          from_date = "2000-01-01",
                          to_date = "2022-12-31")
```

The wrapper function already returns an object of the type data frame, which means that there is no need to parse any data. To facilitate the further analysis steps, only relevant variables are selected and encoded to UTF-8. Subsequently the data is stored on the working directory to use it for the further analyses.

```{r}
# Save data as data frame
df <- api_request %>% select(-tags)
df <- as.data.frame(df)

# Reduce data to minimum amount of variables
ga_clean <- df %>% 
  select(web_title, headline, web_publication_date)

# Convert text to UTF-8
Encoding(ga_clean$headline) <- "UTF-8"

# Save clean data
write.csv(ga_clean, here::here("ga_clean.csv"))
```

After collecting all data from the APIs, the first analysis can be conducted: a sentiment analysis using the Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER). VADER is a part of the Natural Language Processing Toolkit (NLTK), a Python library. It is a lexicon-based approach for detecting sentiments in a given text. Although it is optimised for social media posts, it can be expected to function sufficiently on news headlines, since it assigns predefined values for connotations of language terms.\
Here, the polarity scores are calculated into a newly created variable, which is then used to extract the compound, a single metric ranging from -1 to 1, which summaries the overall sentiment within one single headline. Finally, a categorisation into positive, neutral and negative is implemented, using the borders of 0.05 and -0,05, as suggested by Xiang et al. (2021).

```{python}
sid = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

# Import data
df = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "ga_clean.csv"))

# Calculate scores
df['scores'] = df['headline'].apply(lambda review: sid.polarity_scores(review))

df['compound']  = df['scores'].apply(lambda score_dict: score_dict['compound'])

def categorize(value):
    if value >= 0.05:
        return 'pos'
    elif value <= -0.05:
        return 'neg'
    else:
        return 'neu'
df['comp_score'] = df['compound'].apply(categorize)

# Show head of results
print(df.head())

# Export csv
df.to_csv(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "ga_clean_VADER2.csv"), index = False)
```

After calculating the sentiment metrics, a visualisation can be made to visually examine the patterns within the data. First, a theme is set for the graphical layout:

```{r}
custom_theme <-   theme(axis.text = element_text(color="black", size=12, family="serif"),
                        axis.text.x = element_text(color="black", size=12, family="serif"),
                        axis.ticks.x = element_line(),
                        axis.ticks.y = element_line(),
                        axis.line.x = element_line(size=0.5, color="grey"),
                        axis.line.y = element_line(size=0.5, color="grey"),
                        panel.grid = element_line(color = "honeydew2",
                                                  size = 0.5,
                                                  linetype = 1),
                        panel.background = element_rect(fill="white"),
                        plot.margin = margin(10,10,10,10),
                        plot.title = element_text(color="black", size=16, family="serif"),
                        plot.subtitle = element_text(color="grey26", size=14, family="serif"),
                        legend.text = element_text(color="black", size=12, family="serif"),
                        text = element_text(color="black", size=14, family="serif")
                        )
```

To get a grasp of the two variables at interest (stock performance, sentiment score), they are inspected as a function over time. Before this, some data manipulation is necessary. The manipulation steps are the following:\
1. import VADER data from sentiment analysis.\
2. change date variable in VADER to date format.\
3. create a new data frame object which holds the average sentiment per day and not per news headline.\
4. in June 2022, a stock split was conducted on the Amazon stock (Source). This means, that existing stocks were divided into several parts, resulting in a lower stock price while the company kept its overall value. To keep the data comparable, all stock values after June 2022 can be multiplied with 20.\
5. for the stock data, a slightly bigger time period is covered. Therefore, the time range is reduced to the available period in the news data.\
6. making sure, both date variables match the data type "Date".\
7. merge stock data and sentiment values.\
Since the sentiment score ranges from -1 to 1, the stock data is displayed as a proportion of its maximal value (percentage). Thus, the visualisation also ranges from -1 to 1.

```{r}
# Import data
# News headlines with SA scores
VADER <- import(here::here("ga_clean_VADER.csv"))
VADER$date <- as.Date(VADER$web_publication_date)

# Calculate average sentiment per day
df_means_VADER <- VADER %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(mean_compound = mean(compound))

# Correct stock data for stock split in June 2022
amzn$value <- amzn$close_data
amzn$value[amzn$date > '2022-06-03'] <- amzn$value*20

# Merge stock values and sentiment scores for dates
# Create stock df for merging
amzn_join <- amzn %>%
  filter(date >= '2000-01-01' & date <= '2022-12-31') %>%
  select(date, value)
# Set variable "date" to same type for both dfs
df_means_VADER$date <- as.Date(df_means_VADER$date)
amzn_join$date <- as.Date(amzn_join$date)
# Create df
df <- right_join(df_means_VADER, amzn_join)

# Visualisation of stock and sentiment data over time
df %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x=date, y=mean_compound), col="dodgerblue") +
  geom_line(aes(x=date, y=value/max(value)), col="dodgerblue4") +
  xlab("Date") +
  ylab("Value") +
  scale_x_date(date_minor_breaks = "1 day") +
  custom_theme
```

Subsequently, the correlation between stock performance and sentiment score is to be calculated. First, a scatter plot is created to visually examine the relationship between the two variables. As a third variable, date is kept but only shown as a gradient change of color.

```{r}
# Visualise correlation between stock value and sentiment score
df %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x=mean_compound, y=value, col = date)) +
  xlab("Sentiment Score") +
  ylab("Value") +
  custom_theme
```

To calculate the correlation, Pearson's R is used as a metric since it allows the inclusion of two continuous variables:

```{r}
cor.test(df$mean_compound, df$value, use="complete.obs")
```
